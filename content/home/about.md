# Data, Decisions, Dreams, & Coffee

I currently a senior at Brown University. In the fall of 2020, I will be a PhD Student in Behavioral Decision Research at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm passionate about my research in decision and data science, and I love coffee, Disney, and the phrase "Dream big."
